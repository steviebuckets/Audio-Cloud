##Summary
I originally set out to make a web application that would allow users to search for their favorite podcasts. Ultimately I decided to use the Mixcloud API as it allowed for audio widgets to stream user uploads. As it stands now, users can enter a search query for a Mixcloud user and the app returns their latest upload and allows them to stream the audio. The app is pretty limited at this point and found the documentation and examples not that helpful. I plan to revist the app in the coming months as my knowledge grows and add on more functionality and purpose. It's a good starting point for now but definitely far from finished.
